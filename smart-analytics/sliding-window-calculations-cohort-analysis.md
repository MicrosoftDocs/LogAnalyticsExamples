## Cohorts analysis
#### #let #union #project

### What is "cohorts analysis"?
Cohort analysis tracks the activity of specific groups of users (AKA "Cohorts"). The users are grouped by the time they first used the service (e.g. "October 2017").
Cohorts analysis attempts to measure how appealing a service, by measure the rate of returning users.

### Good to know
When analyzing cohorts, it is expected to find a decreese in activity over the first tracked periods.
Each cohort is titled by the week in which its members were observed for the first time.

### Cohort analysis example - 5 weeks
In the following example we analyze the number of activities users perform over the course of 5 weeks, following their first use of the service.

Labels:
* r0 - the distinct count of members of the cohort in the first week when they were observed
* r1 - the distinct count of members of the cohort that were active also in the week after then were observed (or after)
* r2 - ... in the following week

```AIQL
let startDate = startofweek(bin(datetime(2017-01-20T00:00:00Z), 1d));
let week = range Cohort from startDate to datetime(2017-03-01T00:00:00Z) step 7d;

// For each user we find the first and last timestamp of activity
let FirstAndLastUserActivity = (end:datetime) 
{
    customEvents
    | where customDimensions["sourceapp"]=="ai-loganalyticsui-prod"
    // Check 30 days back to see first time activity
    | where timestamp > startDate - 30d
    | where timestamp < end      
    | summarize min=min(timestamp), max=max(timestamp) by user_AuthenticatedId
};

let DistinctUsers = (cohortPeriod:datetime, evaluatePeriod:datetime) {
    toscalar (
    FirstAndLastUserActivity(evaluatePeriod)
    // Find members of the cohort: only users that were observed in this period for the first time
    | where min >= cohortPeriod and min < cohortPeriod + 7d  
    // Pick only the members that were active during the evaluated period or after
    | where max > evaluatePeriod - 7d
    | summarize dcount(user_AuthenticatedId)) 
};

week 
| where Cohort == startDate

// Finally, calculate the desired metric for each cohort. In this sample we calculate distinct users but you can change
// this to any other metric that would measure the engagement of the cohort members.
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+7d),
    r1 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+14d),
    r2 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+21d),
    r3 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+28d),
    r4 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+35d)
| union (week | where Cohort == startDate + 7d 
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers(startDate+7d, startDate+14d),
    r1 = DistinctUsers(startDate+7d, startDate+21d),
    r2 = DistinctUsers(startDate+7d, startDate+28d),
    r3 = DistinctUsers(startDate+7d, startDate+35d) )
| union (week | where Cohort == startDate + 14d 
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers(startDate+14d, startDate+21d),
    r1 = DistinctUsers(startDate+14d, startDate+28d),
    r2 = DistinctUsers(startDate+14d, startDate+35d) )
| union (week | where Cohort == startDate + 21d 
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers(startDate+21d, startDate+28d),
    r1 = DistinctUsers(startDate+21d, startDate+35d) ) 
| union (week | where Cohort == startDate + 28d 
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers (startDate+28d, startDate+35d) )

// Calculate the retention percentage for each cohort by weeks
| project Cohort, r0, r1, r2, r3, r4,
          p0 = r0/r0*100,
          p1 = todouble(r1)/todouble (r0)*100,
          p2 = todouble(r2)/todouble(r0)*100,
          p3 = todouble(r3)/todouble(r0)*100,
          p4 = todouble(r4)/todouble(r0)*100 
| sort by Cohort asc
```

The output will look like this:
